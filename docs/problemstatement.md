# Project Problem Statement: Facts-Only Mutual Fund FAQ Assistant

## Overview
The objective of this project is to build a **facts-only FAQ assistant** for mutual fund schemes, using **Groww** as the reference product context. The assistant will answer objective, verifiable queries related to mutual funds by retrieving information exclusively from official public sources, such as **AMC (Asset Management Company)** websites, **AMFI**, and **SEBI**. 

The system must strictly avoid providing investment advice, opinions, or recommendations. Every response must include a single, clear source link and adhere to defined constraints around clarity, accuracy, and compliance.

---

## Objective
Design and implement a lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based assistant that:
- Answers factual queries about mutual fund schemes.
- Uses a curated corpus of official documents.
- Provides concise, source-backed responses.

---

## Target Users
- **Retail investors** comparing mutual fund schemes.
- **Customer support and content teams** handling repetitive mutual fund queries.

---

## Scope of Work

### 1. Corpus Definition
- **Select one Asset Management Company (AMC)**.
- **Choose 3–5 mutual fund schemes**, ensuring category diversity (e.g., large-cap, flexi-cap, ELSS).
- **Collect 15–25 official public URLs**, including:
  - Scheme factsheets
  - KIM (Key Information Memorandum)
  - SID (Scheme Information Document)
  - AMC FAQ/help pages
  - AMFI/SEBI guidance pages
  - Statement and tax document download guides

### 2. FAQ Assistant Requirements
The assistant must answer facts-only queries, such as:
- Expense ratio of a scheme
- Exit load details
- Minimum SIP amount
- ELSS lock-in period
- Riskometer classification
- Benchmark index
- Process to download statements or capital gains reports

#### Strict Response Rules:
1. Each response is limited to a **maximum of 3 sentences**.
2. Each response includes **exactly one citation link**.
3. Each response includes a footer:  
   `Last updated from sources: <date>`

### 3. Refusal Handling
The assistant must refuse non-factual or advisory queries, such as:
- *"Should I invest in this fund?"*
- *"Which fund is better?"*

#### Refusal Response Guidelines:
- Be polite and clearly worded.
- Reinforce the facts-only limitation.
- Provide a relevant educational link (e.g., AMFI or SEBI resource).

### 4. User Interface (Minimal)
The solution should include a simple interface with:
- A **welcome message**
- **Three example questions**
- A **visible disclaimer**:  
  > *"Facts-only. No investment advice."*

---

## Constraints

### 1. Data and Sources
- Use **only official public sources** (AMC, AMFI, SEBI).
- **Do not use** third-party blogs or aggregator websites.

### 2. Privacy and Security
Do **not** collect, store, or process any sensitive personal information, including:
- PAN or Aadhaar numbers
- Account numbers
- OTPs
- Email addresses or phone numbers

### 3. Content Restrictions
- **No investment advice** or recommendations.
- **No performance comparisons** or return calculations.
- For performance-related queries, provide a link to the official factsheet only.

### 4. Transparency
- Responses must be short, factual, and verifiable.
- Every answer must include a source link and last updated date.

---

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. README Document
- Setup instructions
- Selected AMC and schemes
- Architecture overview (RAG approach)
- Known limitations

### 2. Disclaimer Snippet
- *"Facts-only. No investment advice."*
